# Corn Python #

A repository for the Python learning journey of Padawan Corn Dog and Knight Brisket.

## Structure ##

There are three main subdirectories in this repository:

-   Exercises
-   LittlePoops
-   Solutions

### Exercises ###

Put your implementation of the exercises here. Create a new folder for each
program, using the naming convention `ex-01`, where you replace the `01` with
the two-digit number of the exercise.

If the exercise has refinements, put each version of the code in a separate
folder. Name the folder for the original exercise `base`, and name each 
refinement folder `r1`, where you replace `1` with the number of the refinement.
For convenince, keep the most current completed version of the code in the root
directory for the exercise.

Here's an example structure for hypothetical exercise 99, which has three
refinements, where you haven't done any work on refinements yet:

```
Exercises
  |
  -> ex-99
       |
       -> base
            |
            -> class.py
            |
            -> main.py
       |
       -> r1
       |
       -> r2
       |
       -> r3
       |
       -> class.py
       |
       -> main.py
```

### LittlePoops ###

This is exactly like the exercises directory, except call subdirectories `lp-xx`
instead of `ex-xx`. Also, little poops don't have refinements, so there's no
need to create subdirectories inside them.

### Solutions ###

This is where I'll put my solutions to exercises and poops. I won't necessarily
do a solution for every assignment, but when I do, I'll mirror the structure of
your answers.

## Procedures ##

1.  Work on your code locally.
2.  Create a new branch for each project.
3.  Submit a pull request when your code is ready.
4.  Complete a code review, back and forth with me, until you're cleared to commit.
5.  Commit to main branch.
