#Change your program created in exercise 3 to 
#add a field to the record (item to the dictionary) that holds a list of contact records.

#When the user contacts a customer, they will need to add that interaction to the customer record.
#Your dictionary should track a list of customer interactions, 
#by making a new dictionary item that holds a list of interaction records.
#Each should have the date and time of the interaction and a note that the user enters.

#Come up with an appropriate user interface whereby the user can 
  #add, view, or delete customer interactions from the customer record.

#Make functions to perform the 
  #adding and deleting of customer interactions.

#Use the standard Python datetime module
#to get the current time when the user adds a customer interaction.
#Decide the best way to store the datetime information in your list.
