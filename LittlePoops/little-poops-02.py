# Let's turn this poop into a little OOP!

# Build a class named Anagrammer:

#     Create a constructor that takes one positional argument named dict_file,
#         In the constructor, define an instance variable named dictionary.
#             Open the file whose name was passed as dict_file and read its contents into the dictionary list
#     Create a static method named is_anagram:
#         Use the function requirements from the original issue post above for this method.
#     Create an instance method named find_anagram that takes one parameter: word:
#         word is the word for which to find an anagram
#         Shuffle the dictionary list (there's a library function that does this, it's with the other random stuff)
#         Find the first anagram in the shuffled dictionary and return it, searching for single-word anagrams only.
#         If there is no anagram, return the original word
#     Create an instance method named list_anagrams that takes one parameter: word:
#         word is the word for which to list the anagrams
#         Sort the word dictionary
#         Find all of the possible anagrams for word, searching for single-word anagrams only
#         Return a sorted list of all the anagrams you found, or a list containing only the original word if there are none

# Build a simple UI that surfaces all of the functionality of the Anagrammer class to the user. You decide whether you want to make a single-instance class to do the UI work, or to do it procedural style. In either case, you'll make a single instance of Anagrammer to use.

# Considerations

#     Don't waste time trying to finding the perfect, most clever solution to finding anagrams! Get something that works, then
#     improve it as you have time and inclination.
#     Think about why we're using an object for Anagrammer, since we'll only be using a single instance of it. There's at least one
#     good reason.
#     Think about what it would take to:
#         Find multi-word anagrams
#         Filter the dictionary list to quickly get to a list that's worth the effort of a deeper comparison
